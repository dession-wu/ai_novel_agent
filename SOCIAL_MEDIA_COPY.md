📣 [Open Source] NOVA: An AI Writing Assistant That Actually Works

Hey r/writing community!

I've been working on a project that I think could really help fellow writers, and I'm excited to share it with you.

**Introducing NOVA** - an AI writing assistant designed specifically for novelists and storytellers.

### What makes NOVA different?

- **It understands your world** - Not just generating text, but maintaining consistency with your existing worldbuilding
- **Multiple AI models** - Works with OpenAI, Claude, and DeepSeek
- **Visual worldbuilding** - Interactive management of characters, locations, and rules
- **Smart proofreading** - Catches plot holes and inconsistencies
- **Project management** - Organize multiple novels and track your progress

### Why I built this

As someone who's struggled with writer's block and maintaining consistent worldbuilding across long projects, I wanted a tool that actually understands the creative process, not just spits out generic text.

### Try it out

It's completely open source and free to use:
